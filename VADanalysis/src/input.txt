I am very happy today.
Are you angry to me...?
Oh my dear, you looks so beautiful.
Oh my god, how pity you are.
Let's take a rest, I am so tired.
Excuse me.
Do you have your forms?
Yeah.
Let me see them.
Is there a problem?
Who told you to get in this line?
You did.
You were standing at the beginning and you directed me.
Okay. But I didn't tell you to get in this line if you are filling out this particular form.
Well what's the problem?  Let me change it.
This form is a Z.X.four.
You can't--  This is not the line for Z.X.four.  If you're going to fill out the Z.X.four, you need to have a different form of ID.
What?  I'm getting an ID.  This is why I'm here.  My wallet was stolen.
No. I need another set of ID to prove this is actually you.
How am I supposed to get an ID without an ID?  How does a person get an ID in the first place?
I don't know.  But I need an ID to pass this form along.  I can't just send it along without an ID.
I'm here to get an ID.
No.  I need another ID, a separate one.
Like what?  Like a birth certificate?
A birth certificate, a passport...a student ID; didn't you go to school?  Anything?
Who the hell has a birth certificate?
Yes but my wallet was stolen, I don't have anything.  I don't have any credit cards, I don't have my ID.  Don't you have things on file here?
Yeah.  We keep it on file, but we need an ID to access that file.
That's out of control.
I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID.
How long have you been working here?
Actually too long.
Clearly.  You know, do you have like a supervisor or something?
Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back.
That would - I would appreciate that.  Yeah.
